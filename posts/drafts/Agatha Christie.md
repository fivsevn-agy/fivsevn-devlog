This list is designed for readers looking to discover Agatha Christie's works in order of publication. If the date differs between the UK and US, we have opted for the first instance of publishing. It features all her novels, short story collections and plays, as well as Christie continuation stories, and informative books about her life (some of which she wrote). We hope you enjoy exploring the breadth, depth and volume of her output. For the completists, you can tick off each book as and when you read it, to keep track of which stories remain to discover.
