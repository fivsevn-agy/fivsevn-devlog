# posts — Module Map

Purpose:
Define structure of the Temporal axis.

This module is organized by time.

---

## 1. Structural Principle

Primary ordering logic:
- Chronological progression
- Thought evolution
- Reflective sequence

It is not object-based.

---

## 2. Content Nature

Posts may include:

- Essays
- Reflections
- Concept notes
- Cross-domain synthesis
- Announcements

They are temporal entries,
not structural containers.

---

## 3. Interaction With Other Axes

A post may:

- Reference natsci
- Reference netcom
- Reference system

However:

posts do not define domain structure.

They record thinking over time.

---

## 4. Stability Rule

posts grow through:

- Ongoing reflection
- Documentation of intellectual trajectory

They do not create new axes.
