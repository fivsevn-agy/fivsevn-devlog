# Module Map — Global Topology

- Purpose: Define structural axes of the fivsevn knowledge system.

---
## 1. Structural Model

- The system is multi-dimensional.

- Content is organized along independent axes:
  - Temporal axis
  - Object axis
  - System axis
  - Protocol axis

- These are not categories.
- They are cognitive organization dimensions.

---
## 2. Core Axes

### 2.1 posts — Temporal Axis
- Organized by time.
- Represents reflection and evolving thought.
- Primary ordering: chronological.

---
### 2.2 natsci — Object / Taxonomic Axis
- Organized by natural objects.
- Classification-based structure.
- Focus: biological and material entities.

---
### 2.3 netcom — System / Engineering Axis
- Organized by technical systems.
- Structure-driven.
- Focus: protocols, topology, hardware, infrastructure.

---
### 2.4 system — Kernel / Protocol Layer
- Defines meta-structure.
- Contains boot protocol.
- Contains module topology.
- Not domain content.

---
## 3. Axis Interaction

- Documents may exist simultaneously on:
  - Temporal axis (via posts)
  - Domain axis (via natsci or netcom)

Metadata resolves positioning.

---
## 4. Expansion Rule

A new axis may be created only if:

- It develops stable methodology.
- It has independent structural logic.
- It is sustainable long-term.
- It is not a temporary interest cluster.
